# Anki 2.1 Timer Stopwatch Addon

Built-in Clock, Timer and Stopwatch for Anki 2.1 
The following is a simple time management tool that allows you to have a timer and stopwatch inside of Anki. At this point only version 2.1 is supported but let me know in the add-on discussions if support for Anki 2.0 is needed. 

After installing the add-on will be located under the "Tools" menu.

**The following is the *main screen* of the add-on...**
